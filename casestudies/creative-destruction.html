      <p>In this case, we visit two companies that refused to innovate.</p>
      
      

<h1 id="the-company-wouldn-t-innovate">The Company Wouldn&rsquo;t Innovate</h1>

<p>If companies don&rsquo;t innovate, they will die. These stories are legion in B-schools and make great fodder for case studies. From 1955 to today, only about 12% of fortune-500 companies survive.</p>

<p>And this fact has been know for many years. Why is it then, that I run into companies that ignore this? Perhaps I can offer ways companies can avoid this fate. Here are a couple of stories, followed by my recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="first-company">First Company</h2>

<p>This company had great lineage, having been spun off from a scientific laboratory for a large telco.</p>

<p>The spin-off produced and maintained high-speed Internet data routers. Their flagship router had over two million lines of code, and I went in as part of the software group. We&rsquo;d fix bugs and add new features, including support for new cards. The switch itself had a mid-plane design. The front half was purely digital processors, and the back half handled the optical.</p>

<p>There were about fifty engineers of one sort or the other in the group. Unfortunately for us, corporate noted that their N.R.E. costs were too high for the revenue so something had to be done.</p>

<p>They brought in a firing-manager, who&rsquo;s job it was to trim the group.</p>

<h3 id="an-idea">An idea</h3>

<p>Instead of waiting to get trimmed, I came up with the idea of using telephones over the Internet. This was way before Vonage or other Internet phone companies existed.</p>

<p>The division maintained some legacy hard-wired last-mile switches that were still profitable.</p>

<p>I can still remember pitching the proposal to the management. I at one end of a large desk, and the firing-manager at the other. He was glaring at me. At one point he asked with credulity, &ldquo;What, why would we give you seed money for something that will kill the profitability of our current products? My answer was simple, you need to innovate or die. I pointed out that technical progress was quickly obsoleting wired telco system.</p>

<p>Alexander Graham Bell had invented the telephone, and we could re-invent it to work over the emerging Internet. And we were well positioned. We could have added priority channels to our core switching systems in support of our Internet phones. We could have gotten in early, and cornered the market.</p>

<h3 id="my-arguments-fell-on-deaf-ears">My arguments fell on deaf ears</h3>

<p>Two weeks later, they threw me out.</p>

<h2 id="second-company">Second Company</h2>

<p>I can use the name of the second company as they are long gone.</p>

<p>Digital Equipment Company (DEC) sold a line of low-cost computing equipment with the marketing name micro-vax. It was about twice the size of a dorm refrigerator. It was an updated descendant of the PDP-11, a 16 bit computer. The micro-vax had a 32 bit complex instruction set little-endian processor with a paging memory system they had copied from a Burroughs machine.(We even used the Burroughs technical manual when we met to design the vax.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their president Kenneth H. Olson was famously quoted as saying &ldquo;There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.&rdquo; so we weren&rsquo;t going into personal computing any time soon.</p>

<p>He was truly a pioneer and the company was an innovation hub. Ideas sprang forth and either the company adopted them or a new company was spun off.</p>

<p>We worked with this guy who thought he could design a single-board computer, so one weekend, he goes down to one of the stockrooms, checks out the chips, and goes home and assembles it in his basement. The company was so impressed, they decided to market it.</p>

<p>I myself had done some of this midnight innovation. I combined two of the companies operating systems into one. The advantage here was that our hardware was even more versatile. For this, I was given some stock.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>

<p>So one day, we are sitting around, and we can see clearly the P.C. market emerging, so we get the idea to hike over to the corporate offices and knock some sense into Ken.</p>

<p>We never did it though. Ken&rsquo;s hold on the company was so strong that we felt it would have been a waste of time.</p>

<p>Additional, a product manager for the micro-vax was incredulous. &ldquo;What&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;you want to kill of my profitable line of micro-vax computers?&rdquo; Well, yes, because it&rsquo;s the future.</p>

<p>Remember, this was a time when some guy out in California (Steve Jobs) had just built a P.C. in his garage and was marketing it. You could run either a Pascal operating system or the newly emerging Disk Operating System  (DOS)marketed by another guy (Bill Gates).</p>

<p>We could have crushed them.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-common-theme">What&rsquo;s the common theme?</h2>

<p>Each company blocked innovation for quarterly profits to share-holders. This innovation would have brought creative destruction and replaced the old with the new.</p>

<p>And, each company no longer exists.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h2>

<p><strong><em>A skunk-works division should be created who&rsquo;s charter is to dream big, and then bring these big dreams to market</em></strong>.
The division should not be bound by the quarterly constraints to the shareholders. After all, don&rsquo;t these same shareholders benefit in the long run?</p>
