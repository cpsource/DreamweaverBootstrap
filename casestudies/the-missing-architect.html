    <p>In this case, we visit a sub-contractor working on an interface to a telephone switch for a much larger client.</p>
    <p>The client realized the project was late and was putting pressure on the sub-contractor, who in turn was pressuring the engineering staff. The team consisted of about ten engineers.</p>
    <p>I was hired, extensively to provide more person-power to help push the project over the finish line.</p>
    <h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
    <p>The switch interface was designed to monitor and display switch performance for a call center. A graphical display would show the call volume, and other information such as rans, or the number of disconnects before someone was connected. I was to work on the graphical display.</p>
    <h2 id="other-issues">Other Issues</h2>
    <p>The sub-contractor was also having trouble keeping the development environment working. They didn&rsquo;t have an IT department and no one knew the proper way to configure the machines.</p>
    <p>From time to time, the entire development system would stop working, often for days. We&rsquo;d sit around wondering what to do.</p>
    <p>Eventually, prime caught up with this issue and demanded a fix. The sub went out and ordered an entirely new development to fix the problem and this appeared to appease the prime, at least for a bit.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="color: tomato">Red Alert. Was this the issue?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I had always done my own system administration, and it was simple for me to correct any issues, such as NFS mounting individual machines on a server. Voilà, we now had a functioning development environment.</p>
    <h2 id="back-to-the-main-issue">Back to the main issue</h2>
    <p>Ok, I&rsquo;ve got to build a screen to display data. What should it look like? I went to the architect and asked for a specification or for that matter, any document, or perhaps his time, to explain what was to be built.</p>
    <p>What I found was a burned-out architect. He was under so much stress from management, he could barely speak in coherent sentences. Was there a spec? No. What was I to do? He directed me to some sales literature that had been previously put out that showed happy users smiling at a terminal screen in the background. &ldquo;Code to this&rdquo;, he says.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="color: tomato">Red Alert: Was the architect doing his job?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="i-try-to-help">I try to help</h2>
    <p>I went to management and tried to offer some advice.
      1. I should train someone to manage the development environment
      2. The architect needed to provide critical guidance</p>
    <p>For my troubles I was canned on the spot. How dare, I, a mere software engineer offer this kind of advice?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="color: tomato">Red Alert: Was management in touch with the project?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="more-to-the-story">More to the story</h2>
    <p>About two weeks later, I was called back in. It seems the development system had shutdown again and no one know how to get it back up and running.</p>
    <p>The newer HP equipment hadn&rsquo;t come yet and they were still dependent on their current hardware.</p>
    <p>I stayed on the best I could, using the sales literature as an architectural guide.</p>
    <p>A bit later, the HP equipment arrived, and we started using newer computers. But, as you should surmise by now, this change would DO NOTHING to solve the project&rsquo;s problems.</p>
    <p>The prime noted this to, and canceled the project. The sub was now out of the loop. Prime stated the project was too important so it was being brought in-house.</p>
    <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>I call these types of projects Train Wrecks because I know the ending. Sooner or later, the train will jump the tracks, most probably over a trestle, and plunge into the river with a fierily explosion.</p>
    <p>What should the management have done?</p>
    <p>For starters, get some real architecture done. Software developers need more than two year old sales literature to code a project.</p>
    <p>Management should have had someone in IT to manage the development environment. They could have contracted for someone to come in as needed to keep costs low. Having a whole ten person team idled for days is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>They desperately needed some basic project management. Agile-lite, whereby you have two week sprints, would have been a good idea. Meeting daily for fifteen minutes would keep management up-to-speed as well as provide guidance to the engineering staff. The two week sprint milestones would have alerted management to schedule slips at an early stage.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="color: tomato">Question: How does a project get one year behind? One day at a time!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="a-little-bit-about-telecom-work-culture">A little bit about telecom work culture</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve worked in Bell Labs and baby bells and they are extremely autocratic and heretical. Orders come from the top down and must not be questioned.</p>
    <p>It might have explained my initial firing.</p>
    <p>But listening and including engineering staff as part of the team was sorely missing.</p>
