    <p>In this case, the vendor-customer relationship had to change.</p>
    
    <h2 id="initial-entry">Entry to vendor site</h2>
    <p>I was asked by a manager to take a look at a project to see why it was running late. There there were about eight engineers who appeared competent, and they were working as hard as they could to complete the project.</p>
    <p>I called them together into a conference room and asked them why they thought they were running late.</p>
    <p>They spoke up immediately. It seems the sales accountant was popping in ever day or so with significant changes to the deliverables.</p>
    <p>The engineering staff said they could do this but there might be a schedule slip. The sales guy communicated the first part back to the customer, but not the second.</p>
    <p>By now, of course, the project was late and the customer was pressuring the team to deliver. They&rsquo;d call upper management and complain and threaten legal action. This pressure was brought down by management and placed on the team. Couldn&rsquo;t they work faster, on and on.</p>
    <h2 id="my-response">My Response</h2>
    <p>I told the team we needed to change the model for the E.C.O. (engineering change order) process.</p>
    <p>Before I got out of the meeting, the sales guy pops in again with yet another change request.</p>
    <p>I jump up and say &ldquo;See!&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Everyone rolls their eyes.</p>
    <h2 id="some-theory">Some Theory</h2>
    <p>You can have two process models here. In the first, customer and prime write a specification and agree on a fixed price and schedule for the work. In the second model, the customer pays per hour of engineering time, and can make as many changes as they want at any time. They understand the schedule slips out and that it will cost more.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="color: tomato"><strong><em>Projects that mix these two types improperly get into trouble.</em></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For the case we are discussing, the vendor had started with a fixed-price fixed-deliverables fixed-time model, but they picked up the flexibility of the time-and-materials model for changes.</p>
    <h2 id="what-had-to-change">What had to change?</h2>
    <p>I suggested that when the client wished a change, they put it in writing. The sales rep would communicate this back to engineering, who would attach a cost and schedule change to it. The sales rep would then communicate this back to the customer, who would then decide if they really wanted that specific feature.</p>
    <h2 id="is-there-one-right-way-for-customer-communications">Is there one right way for customer communications?</h2>
    <p>No. But don&rsquo;t mix them as in this example.</p>
    <p>I once did a time-and-materials project for a claims processing company in N.J. and I actually worked on their site. They&rsquo;d come to me with what I thought was a weird way of doing thing, but no they said, this is how they did it before on previous processing equipment.</p>
    <p>So I get done, and their claims are flowing smoothly through the machine. They were quite satisfied, as of course, they got exactly what they wanted.</p>
    <p>But, it turns out, the team that ran this claims processing center told other teams in other companies what a great product they had. And, soon, I was getting requests to install the very same software at other sites.</p>
    <p>In the end, I had five sites in five different companies up and running.</p>
    <p>If I had gone the other more rigid route, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been as satisfied and I am sure, would not have refereed my product to their friends in the industry.</p>
    <h2 id="the-moral-of-this-story">The moral of this story?</h2>
    <p>You need to work in some flexibility to allow for change up-front. You will have a much more successful project if you do.</p>
    <h1 id="lets-use-our-four-step-analysis">Lets use our four-step analysis</h1>
    <h2 id="medical">Medical</h2>
    <p>The chief complaint was the project&rsquo;s lateness. The customer was upset and the engineers were approaching burnout. The diagnosis was that the customer kept making changes so the engineers could never finish. The Rx was to allow the customer to make changes, but on a time-and-materials basis.</p>
    <h2 id="business">Business</h2>
    <p>Customer relations were not setup up-front with a process to allow changes in the deliverables.</p>
    <h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>
    <p>The engineering staff was hard-working and competent. No help was needed from me here.</p>
    <h2 id="experince">Experince</h2>
    <p>My experience helped me work with the engineering team and draw the problem out of them. Once this was done, my recommended solution was obvious to everyone.</p>
    <h2 id="afterwards-just-an-aside">Afterwards, just an aside</h2>
    <p>Since I was billing out at five times the rate of anyone else in the office, I went to management and asked for either a bonus or a raise. They declined, saying they though something was wrong with me.</p>
    <p>I quit. I found a good woman, got married, raised up two fine kids, and had a wonderful life.</p>
    <p>The moral here is if you don&rsquo;t compensate appropriately and respect your employees, you&rsquo;ll get a lot of turnover.</p>
    <p>And as karma would have it, the company, in the end, went out of business.</p>
