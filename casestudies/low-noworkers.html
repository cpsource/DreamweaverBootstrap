      <p>Corporate labor policies have changed over time and continue to change. This note documents two major and opposite policies. Bad labor practices are discussed.</p>
      
      

<h1 id="two-labor-policies">Two Labor Policies</h1>

<p>There are two major labor policies I&rsquo;ve worked under.</p>

<h2 id="type-i">Type I</h2>

<p>Back in the 70&rsquo;s, corporations would try to hire for life. And if you were fired, the next employer would look apron you askance, as if you were damaged goods. While employed, you were in a pension plan that would kick in when you retired. If work slowed, the corporation was loyal to you and kept you on. The corporation believed in employee training and mapped a career path, be it technical or managerial, you would be expected to follow. In return, the corporation expected loyalty in return. If positions became available, they were posted internally so you could apply.</p>

<h2 id="type-ii">Type II</h2>

<p>Boy, did things change in the 90&rsquo;s. Employees were no longer seen as a corporation&rsquo;s most valuable asset. During a downturn, you would be let go. You pension was replaced with a 401k style plan, whereby you now had to pay into your own retirement fund, that is if you wanted to. And as for a return, you couldn&rsquo;t count on a fixed income, but rather on how the market was doing and how much you pain in initially. If business picked up, corporations would just hire more people.</p>

<p>My mid-career consulting business benefited from this labor practice. I was always the one they could hire when they ramped up again. But they had to pay me an additional 30% or so uplift, so I ask if this is really the best way to run a business.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-changed">What&rsquo;s Changed?</h2>

<p>From my previous lecture, it&rsquo;s apparent that the labor pool is shrinking. Corporations can no longer treat employees as disposable and re-hireable.</p>

<h2 id="some-things-we-should-eliminate-from-labor-practices">Some things we should eliminate from labor practices.</h2>

<p>So, I was on this project that was running late. The manager decides to &lsquo;get-tough&rsquo; with us, calls us all into a room and threatens us with termination. Next, the manager says we would all be working sixty hours to catch up, even though we will were only paid for forty. A rather hostile environment no? One of the employees hacked into the managers computer and made a three finger salute bounce up and down on the screen. The manager had me remove it. Still.</p>

<p>Managers would also push employees to the point of burn-out. Why would they care anyway, as you could just be replaced.</p>

<p>Managers liked (and still do) try to manage input rather than output. Not here at 8:00 sharp, get dinged. After all, you can&rsquo;t work if you&rsquo;re not here, right?</p>

<p>Management structures were often autocratic with decisions flowing down, and never up.</p>

<p>Any sort of sexual harassment doesn&rsquo;t belong in the workplace. I had a woman come to me one time and say a manager had chased her around the conference table. I said lets to to personnel, but no she was afraid for her job, and in those days, she would have lost it.</p>

<p>I once was offered a job where the last guy in it had a heart attack. I asked if they had redesigned the job and the answer was no. My answer was no as well.</p>
