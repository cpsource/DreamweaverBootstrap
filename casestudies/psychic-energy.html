<h1 id="psychic-energy-is-used">Psychic Energy is used</h1>

<p>I used psychic energy to help identify a problem. But before you jump of the rails, this is an absolutely true story.</p>

<p>I happened to be working in New Jersey and was asked by the New York office if I would consult with one of their engineers at a site in Long Island. I took the train over to the city and we rode out in the FA&rsquo;s car.</p>

<p>I have to admit I felt rather bored, having done this so much. Anyway, we arrived on site.</p>

<h2 id="i-commune-with-the-computer">I commune with the computer</h2>

<p>So, I waltz in. The customer is there. The computer is there. I pull up a chair next to the computer and begin to commune with it. To an outsider, it looks like I&rsquo;m meditating, but I&rsquo;m not. Essentially, you open your mind to the collective sub-conscience and you first ask for the answer and then you listen.</p>

<p>Thirty seconds go by, and dead silence in the room. By this time, the FA and the customer were over in a corner talking with each other. The customer asks the FA what I am doing. I say &lsquo;Communing&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to understand we are fifteen miles out of the city - New York City - the land of the NYC minute. It&rsquo;s a tough place, NYC, if you are not used to the culture there.</p>

<p>So, to break the awkward silence, the FA speaks up. &ldquo;You know, I put a patch in last week, and come to think of it, that&rsquo;s when the problem started.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-becomes-obvious">The Solution Becomes Obvious</h2>

<p>Light bulbs go off.</p>

<p>The FA takes the patch out, and the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>The customer thanks us and I return to the city with the FA. Later, I take the train back to Jersey.</p>

<p>I was on-site for a total of fifteen minutes.</p>

<h2 id="cudos-from-my-manager">Cudos from my manager</h2>

<p>The next day, I get a glowing thank you from my manager.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<ol>
<li>I have learned that whenever I walk into a problem, the answer is there already, but can&rsquo;t be seen. All I have to do is bring it to consciousness. Don&rsquo;t be disrespectful of anyone. <strong>Listen.</strong> Draw them out. The problem and solution will appear.</li>
<li>Whether you believe in <strong>psychic-energy</strong> or not, I&rsquo;ve used it time and time again. I know <strong>it&rsquo;s real</strong>.</li>
</ol>
