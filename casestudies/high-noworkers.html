      <p>No workers? A Sr. Labor Economist Ron Hetrick takes a look from ten thousand feet.</p>
      
      

<p>You see help wanted signs everywhere. It might be easy to blame COVID, but it&rsquo;s not that simple. Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w05QgHwq8Ig">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w05QgHwq8Ig</a> where Ron Hetrick takes a ten-thousand foot look.</p>

<p>To summarize some of his key points:
- The baby boomers&rsquo; are leaving the job market faster than our society can replace them. We should have a replacement rate of around 2.1, but right now, we are at 1.7.
- Our immigration has dropped to zero whereas previously we were adding about one-half a million people per year to our economy.
- Workers feel they can quit and find a better paying job. They can and they are.</p>

<p>Ron also notes some things employers can do to find the workers they need. He divides them up into short-term and long-term.</p>

<h2 id="short-term">Short Term</h2>

<ul>
<li>Wages - Well yes and no. In the longer term, these aren&rsquo;t as powerful a motivator as other factors.</li>
<li>Non-wage passion for the workplace is important. The French phrase says it best: you&rsquo;ve got to have esprit de corp.</li>

<li><p>Simplify job descriptions to make hiring easier and offer in-house career training for your workers.</p>

<h2 id="long-term">Long Term</h2></li>

<li><p>Workforce planning should be done starting at the board level then the executive suite.</p></li>

<li><p>Promote good people</p></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t let good people quit. If they want flex hours, you can do that easier than hiring another person.</p></li>

<li><p>Partner with other organizations should a schools where you can interest students in your company.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="at-the-ground-level">At the ground level</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at the ground level and seen corporate fads come and go. I&rsquo;ll tell some of these stories here: <a href="/casestudies/low-noworkers.html">http://redfireconsultants.org/casestudies/low-noworkers.html</a></p>
